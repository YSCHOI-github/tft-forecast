## Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Fusion Transformers

Based on: Temporal Fusion Transformers for Interpretable Multi-horizon Time Series Forecasting 
Authors: Bryan Lim, Sercan Arik, Nicolas Loeff and Tomas Pfister

Proposal: https://github.com/damu4/tft-forecast/raw/main/proposal.pdf

Project goals:

1. Reproduce the model on PyTorch framework.

2. In the original paper data used from 2000-01-03 to 2019-06-28. I will train model on data to 2021-05-01.

3. Tune model's hyperparameters.

4. Change the model: #TODO
